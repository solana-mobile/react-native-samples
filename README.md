## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before trying out any of the apps, ensure you have the following:

- Any Android device or emulator (Solana Mobile devices are not necessary!)
- React Native development environment ([setup guide](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local))
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Android Studio (Recommended)
- [Mock MWA Wallet](https://docs.solanamobile.com/react-native/test-with-any-android-device#mock-mwa-wallet) - Required for testing wallet connections and transactions similar to how it takes place on Seeker. Follow the setup instructions on their github and test out the wallet authentication prior to proceeding with development.

Each sample includes its own detailed setup instructions.
