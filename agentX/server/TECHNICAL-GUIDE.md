## Overview

agentX is built around one architectural principle: **the agent lives on the server, the phone is a signing terminal.**

The agent runs persistently on the server. It reasons over live market data, creates price alerts, and builds swap transactions entirely server-side. The mobile app's only jobs are to display the agent's output and to sign transactions the user approves — it never runs business logic and never touches a private key directly. The WebSocket connection is the bridge between them: the server streams agent reasoning to the phone in real time, and the phone sends back signing outcomes.

This separation matters for two reasons:
- **Security**: private keys stay in the device's secure enclave (Seed Vault), never transmitted to the server. The server only ever sees the user's public key, which it needs solely as the `feePayer` for Jupiter transaction building.
- **Autonomy**: because the agent is server-side, it can act on price alerts even when the app is in the background or killed — the push notification is just a wake signal to surface the already-built transaction.

In practice, the server:

1. Accepts prompts from the mobile app via WebSocket or REST
2. Runs Claude Sonnet 4.6 with access to Solana-aware tools
3. Streams the agent's reasoning back to the mobile app token-by-token
4. Monitors SOL prices autonomously and invokes the agent when alerts trigger
5. Builds real Jupiter swap transactions and pushes them to the phone for signing
6. Polls the Solana RPC after signing to confirm the transaction landed on-chain

---

## Trust Model

Understanding who holds what is essential for extending this system.

| Entity | Holds | Never holds |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Server | Business logic, conversation history, price alerts, serialized (unsigned) transactions, wallet *public* key | Private keys, seed phrases |
| Mobile app | UI state, session ID, push token | Business logic, unsigned transactions (only shown briefly in modal) |
| Device wallet (Seed Vault / MWA) | Private keys | Nothing from agentX |

**The signing flow enforces this boundary:**

1. The agent builds a `VersionedTransaction` on the server using the user's *public* key as `feePayer`
2. The serialized (still unsigned) transaction is sent to the phone over WebSocket
3. The `AgentTxModal` shows the trade details and the agent's reason — the user decides to approve or reject
4. On approval, MWA passes the transaction to the device wallet (Seed Vault). The private key never leaves the secure enclave — the wallet signs inside it and returns only the signature
5. The mobile app sends the base58 signature back to the server via `tx_signed`
6. The server records the signature and confirms on-chain — it cannot modify or replay the transaction

**What the server can and cannot do:**

- ✅ Build a transaction for any swap the agent decides on
- ✅ Push that transaction to the phone and send a push notification
- ❌ Sign anything — it has no key material
- ❌ Force a swap — the user must tap "Sign & Send" in the modal
- ❌ See what else is in the user's wallet or submit transactions without user approval

The result: the agent is autonomous up until the moment money moves. That step always requires an explicit human action on the device.

### Key Integration Points

- **[AgentRunner.ts](src/agent/AgentRunner.ts)** — The agent orchestrator. All LLM interactions go through here.
- **[wsRouter.ts](src/routes/wsRouter.ts)** — The WebSocket handler. All real-time communication passes through here.
- **[priceMonitor.ts](src/jobs/priceMonitor.ts)** — The autonomous loop. This is what makes the system "agentic" without user interaction.
- **[solana.ts](src/agent/tools/solana.ts)** — The tools the agent can call. This is where agent decisions become on-chain actions.

---

## Agent Architecture

### Serialized Prompt Queue

`AgentRunner` processes prompts one at a time via a simple async queue:

```
Prompt A arrives → enqueued
Prompt B arrives → enqueued
[A runs] → streams output → completes
[B runs] → streams output → completes
```

**Why single-threaded?**

- The agent reads DB state (conversation history, pending txs) at the start of each run
- The agent writes DB state (new messages, new alerts, new txs) during the run
- Running two prompts concurrently would cause read-after-write races — e.g., the agent creates an alert in run A, then run B doesn't see it and creates a duplicate
- Fastify handles HTTP concurrency; the queue just serializes agent runs

### Streaming with Vercel AI SDK

```typescript
// src/agent/AgentRunner.ts
const result = streamText({
  model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-6"),
  system: SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  messages,
  maxSteps: 5,
  tools: {
    getSolanaPrice: getSolanaPriceTool,
    createPriceAlert: createPriceAlertTool,
    // Factory: captures sessionId so the tool can read the trigger context
    // set by priceMonitor and store it on the pending_tx row.
    queueSigningRequest: createQueueSigningRequestTool(sessionId),
    getPendingSigningRequests: getPendingSigningRequestsTool,
  },
});

for await (const chunk of result.fullStream) {
  if (chunk.type === 'text-delta') {
    emit('agent_delta', sessionId, chunk.textDelta);
  } else if (chunk.type === 'tool-call') {
    emit('tool_call', sessionId, chunk.toolName, chunk.args);
  } else if (chunk.type === 'tool-result') {
    emit('tool_result', sessionId, chunk.toolName, chunk.result);
  }
}
```

Each event is then broadcast to all WebSocket clients via `clientRegistry.broadcast()`.

**Why emit `tool_call` and `tool_result` separately?**

The mobile app uses `tool_call` events to show a "Fetching price..." indicator *immediately* when Claude decides to call a tool — before the result arrives. This creates a responsive feel even when Jupiter's API takes a few hundred milliseconds.

### System Prompt Design

The agent's system prompt (in `AgentRunner.ts`) establishes:

- **Identity**: autonomous Solana trading agent, acts on behalf of the user
- **Scope restriction**: only SOL ↔ USDC swaps are supported (no other tokens)
- **Autonomous session instructions**: when invoked by the price monitor (not a user), produce a single one-line outcome message, not conversational text
- **Anti-repetition**: the agent must echo specific prices/amounts in its responses, not generic phrases like "I've set up your alert"

### Session Model

Sessions group related messages for conversation context:

- **User sessions**: UUID generated on first app launch, persisted in `AsyncStorage`. Passed in every prompt so the agent sees full conversation history.
- **Autonomous sessions**: created by the price monitor with an `alert_<id>` prefix (e.g., `alert_3`). Separate from the user's chat session — they don't appear in chat history. When an alert fires, the agent's internal reasoning stays out of the chat log; only the signing request surfaces in the UI.

---

## WebSocket Protocol

### Connection

```
ws://<host>:8080/ws
Header: X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>
```

Authentication is checked on upgrade. Invalid key → connection closed with code `1008 Policy Violation`.

On successful connect, the server re-delivers any non-expired pending signing requests immediately. This handles the case where the user opens the app to find a tx waiting.

### Messages: Client → Server

All messages are JSON text frames.

---

#### `prompt` — send a message to the agent

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "payload": {
    "prompt": "Buy SOL when it drops below $150",
    "session_id": "4df6ab7a-b99b-4d95-8dd5-deef11d0aaeb"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `payload.prompt` | string | Yes | The user's message |
| `payload.session_id` | string | No | Continue an existing conversation. Omit for a new session. |

The agent runs asynchronously. Expect a stream of `agent_delta`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, and `agent_done` frames in response.

---

#### `tx_signed` — user approved and wallet signed

Sent after the user approves a signing request in `AgentTxModal` and MWA returns a signature.

```json
{
  "type": "tx_signed",
  "payload": {
    "tx_id": "2e31b14f-1a42-4e91-8ffc-216e3f16c70d",
    "signature": "5Uf8XmFt..."
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tx_id` | string | From the original `tx_signing_request` |
| `signature` | string | Base58 Solana transaction signature returned by MWA |

The server marks status as `signed` immediately and starts polling the Solana RPC in the background. When the transaction lands on-chain, a `tx_confirmed` message is broadcast. If it fails or times out, `tx_failed` is broadcast instead.

---

#### `tx_rejected` — user dismissed the signing request

```json
{
  "type": "tx_rejected",
  "payload": {
    "tx_id": "2e31b14f-1a42-4e91-8ffc-216e3f16c70d",
    "reason": "User dismissed"
  }
}
```

The server marks status as `rejected`. The alert is still `triggered` — it won't fire again unless reset.

---

#### `ping` — keepalive

```json
{ "type": "ping" }
```

Server replies with `{ "type": "pong" }`. Send this periodically to keep the connection alive through NAT/proxy timeouts.

---

### Messages: Server → Client

---

#### `agent_delta` — streaming text token

Fired for each text token as the agent generates its response. Append these to the current message bubble to create a live typing effect.

```json
{
  "type": "agent_delta",
  "payload": {
    "session_id": "4df6ab7a-...",
    "text": "Setting up your "
  }
}
```

**Implementation note:** Replace the accumulated delta text with the final `agent_done.text` value when it arrives — `agent_done.text` is the authoritative complete response.

---

#### `agent_done` — response complete

```json
{
  "type": "agent_done",
  "payload": {
    "session_id": "4df6ab7a-...",
    "text": "Done! I've set a price alert: I'll queue a 1 SOL → USDC swap when SOL drops below $150."
  }
}
```

Persist this message to your local history and finalize the message bubble.

---

#### `tool_call` — agent is invoking a tool

```json
{
  "type": "tool_call",
  "payload": {
    "session_id": "4df6ab7a-...",
    "tool": "getSolanaPrice",
    "input": { "tokenSymbol": "SOL" }
  }
}
```

Use this to show a contextual indicator: map `tool` name to a user-friendly string:

| Tool | Suggested indicator |
|---|---|
| `getSolanaPrice` | "Fetching price..." |
| `createPriceAlert` | "Setting up alert..." |
| `queueSigningRequest` | "Building swap..." |
| `getPendingSigningRequests` | "Checking pending..." |

---

#### `tool_result` — tool returned a value

```json
{
  "type": "tool_result",
  "payload": {
    "session_id": "4df6ab7a-...",
    "tool": "getSolanaPrice",
    "output": { "symbol": "SOL", "price": 185.42, "currency": "USD" }
  }
}
```

Hide the tool indicator when this arrives.

---

#### `tx_signing_request` — agent queued a swap for the user to sign

The most important server-initiated message. Displayed as a modal in the mobile app.

```json
{
  "type": "tx_signing_request",
  "payload": {
    "tx_id": "2e31b14f-1a42-4e91-8ffc-216e3f16c70d",
    "from_token": "SOL",
    "to_token": "USDC",
    "amount": 1.0,
    "serialized_tx": "<base64-encoded Jupiter v0 VersionedTransaction>",
    "reason": "SOL dropped to $142 — executing your buy-the-dip strategy targeting $150 recovery.",
    "trigger": {
      "alert_id": 3,
      "token": "SOL",
      "target_price": 150.00,
      "triggered_price": 142.10,
      "direction": "below"
    },
    "expires_at": "2026-02-27T10:05:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tx_id` | string (UUID) | Unique ID — include in `tx_signed` / `tx_rejected` responses |
| `serialized_tx` | string (base64) | Decode to `Uint8Array`, deserialize as `VersionedTransaction`, pass to MWA |
| `reason` | string | Agent's one-line explanation — show this to the user |
| `trigger` | object | Which price alert fired this (alert_id 0 = agent-initiated directly) |
| `expires_at` | ISO 8601 | **Check before signing** — Jupiter quotes expire ~90s after creation; refuse to sign if past this time |

---

#### `error` — agent or server-side error

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "payload": {
    "session_id": "4df6ab7a-...",
    "message": "Anthropic API rate limit exceeded"
  }
}
```

The WebSocket connection remains open after an error — only the individual agent run failed.

---

#### `tx_confirmed` — transaction landed on-chain

Broadcast after `confirmTxOnChain` sees `confirmationStatus: 'confirmed'` or `'finalized'` from the Solana RPC. The signature can be used to link to Solana Explorer.

```json
{
  "type": "tx_confirmed",
  "payload": {
    "tx_id": "2e31b14f-1a42-4e91-8ffc-216e3f16c70d",
    "signature": "5Uf8XmFt..."
  }
}
```

---

#### `tx_failed` — transaction failed or timed out on-chain

Broadcast when the RPC returns a non-null `err` for the signature, or when the 2-minute polling window expires without confirmation. Common causes: blockhash expired before broadcast, insufficient SOL for fees, slippage exceeded.

```json
{
  "type": "tx_failed",
  "payload": {
    "tx_id": "2e31b14f-1a42-4e91-8ffc-216e3f16c70d",
    "reason": "Transaction failed on-chain: {\"InstructionError\":[0,\"InsufficientFunds\"]}"
  }
}
```

---

#### `pong`

```json
{ "type": "pong" }
```

---

  (or tx_failed if the network rejected it)
```

## REST API Reference

All endpoints except `GET /health` require `X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>` header.

---

### `GET /health`

No auth. Returns server uptime.

```json
{ "ok": true, "uptime": 42.3 }
```

---

### `POST /agent/prompt`

Enqueue a prompt. Returns immediately with `session_id`. Connect to `WS /ws` to receive streaming output.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the price of SOL?",
  "session_id": "optional-uuid-to-continue-conversation"
}
```

**Response `202`:**
```json
{ "session_id": "4df6ab7a-b99b-4d95-8dd5-deef11d0aaeb" }
```

---

### `GET /agent/history`

Fetch all messages across all sessions, ordered oldest-first. Used to hydrate the chat UI on app launch before opening the WebSocket.

**Response `200`:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "id": 1, "session_id": "...", "role": "user", "content": "...", "created_at": "2026-02-22T21:09:00.000Z" },
    { "id": 2, "session_id": "...", "role": "agent", "content": "...", "created_at": "2026-02-22T21:09:03.000Z" }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Only `user` and `agent` roles appear — autonomous agent sessions (`alert_*`) are excluded.

---

### `POST /orders/alert`

Create a price alert. When SOL crosses the target, the server autonomously invokes the agent, which builds a Jupiter swap tx and pushes it to the mobile app.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "token": "SOL",
  "target_price": 150.00,
  "direction": "below",
  "from_token": "SOL",
  "to_token": "USDC",
  "amount": 1.0
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | string | Token to watch — only `"SOL"` currently supported |
| `target_price` | number | Price level that triggers the alert |
| `direction` | `"above"` \| `"below"` | Fire when price goes above or below target |
| `from_token` | `"SOL"` \| `"USDC"` | Token to sell when alert fires |
| `to_token` | `"SOL"` \| `"USDC"` | Token to buy |
| `amount` | number | Amount of `from_token` to swap |

**Response `201`:**
```json
{
  "alert_id": 3, "token": "SOL", "target_price": 150.00,
  "direction": "below", "status": "active", "created_at": "..."
}
```

---

### `GET /orders/alerts`

List price alerts. Filter by `?status=active|triggered|cancelled`.

**Response `200`:** Array of alert objects (same shape as `POST` response).

---

### `DELETE /orders/alerts/:id`

Cancel an active alert. Returns `404` if alert doesn't exist or is already inactive.

**Response `200`:** `{ "ok": true, "alert_id": 3 }`

---

### `POST /device/register`

Register a mobile device's Expo push token. Call on every app launch. Also accepts the user's Solana wallet address — the server needs this to build Jupiter swap transactions (the `feePayer` field requires a real public key).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "push_token": "ExponentPushToken[xxxxxx]",
  "wallet_address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"
}
```

**Response `201`:** `{ "ok": true }`

---

## Agent Tools Reference

These are the tools available to the agent. All live data comes from the price monitor cache (CoinGecko) and Jupiter API (mainnet).

---

### `getSolanaPrice`

Returns the current price of SOL or USDC from the in-memory price cache.

**Input:**
```json
{ "tokenSymbol": "SOL" }
```

**Output:**
```json
{ "symbol": "SOL", "price": 185.42, "currency": "USD" }
```

---

### `createPriceAlert`

Registers a price alert in PostgreSQL. The price monitor checks active alerts on every tick.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "token": "SOL",
  "target_price": 150.0,
  "direction": "below",
  "from_token": "SOL",
  "to_token": "USDC",
  "amount": 1.0
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{ "success": true, "alert_id": 3, ... }
```

**When does this get called?** When the user says something like "buy SOL if it drops below $150" in the chat. The agent interprets the intent and calls this tool with the appropriate parameters.

---

### `queueSigningRequest`

The most consequential tool. It:
1. Fetches a fresh Jupiter quote
2. Builds a serialized `VersionedTransaction`
3. Stores it in `pending_txs` with a 5-minute expiry
4. Broadcasts `tx_signing_request` to all WS clients
5. Sends an Expo push notification to wake the app

**Input:**
```json
{
  "from_token": "SOL",
  "to_token": "USDC",
  "amount": 0.5,
  "reason": "SOL dropped to $142 — executing your strategy."
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{ "success": true, "tx_id": "2e31b14f-...", "connected_clients": 1, "message": "..." }
```

**When does this get called?**
- By the agent during a chat session when the user requests an immediate swap
- By the agent during an autonomous price-alert session when the price target is reached

---

### `getPendingSigningRequests`

Returns all signing requests awaiting user approval. The agent calls this before creating a new signing request to avoid spamming the user with duplicates.

**Input:** *(none)*

**Output:**
```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "pending": [
    { "tx_id": "...", "from_token": "SOL", "to_token": "USDC", "amount": 0.5, "expires_at": "..." }
  ]
}
```

---

## Price Monitor

**File:** [src/jobs/priceMonitor.ts](src/jobs/priceMonitor.ts)

### Polling Intervals

Two independent timers run after server start:

```
Every 60s: fetchPrices()    — call CoinGecko, update in-memory cache
Every 30s: checkAlerts()    — evaluate all active alerts against cached price
```

The fetch interval is longer because CoinGecko has rate limits. The check interval is shorter because price movements can be sudden and we want to catch alerts quickly once the price updates.

### Alert Evaluation

For each active alert:
1. Look up current price from cache (e.g., SOL = $142)
2. Compare against `target_price` and `direction`
3. If triggered: mark alert as `triggered` in DB **immediately** (idempotency gate)
4. Enqueue an autonomous agent session with price context

**Idempotency:** The status is updated to `triggered` in a single DB write before the agent runs. If the 30s tick fires again while the agent is running, it won't find the alert as `active` and won't re-trigger it.

### Autonomous Agent Invocation

When an alert fires, the price monitor calls `AgentRunner.runAutonomous()` with a system-generated prompt:

```
[SYSTEM — price alert triggered]
Token: SOL
Current price: $142.10
User's target: price goes below $150
Configured trade: swap 1 SOL → USDC
Decide whether to queue a signing request.
```

The agent sees this in a fresh session (`alert_3`) and typically:
1. Calls `getSolanaPrice` to confirm the live price
2. Calls `getPendingSigningRequests` to check for existing pending txs
3. Calls `queueSigningRequest` if no duplicates exist

---

## Jupiter Integration

**File:** [src/solana/buildTx.ts](src/solana/buildTx.ts)

### Transaction Build Flow

For a swap (e.g., 1 SOL → USDC):

```
1. GET https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/quote
   ?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112    ← SOL mint
   &outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v  ← USDC mint
   &amount=1000000000    ← 1 SOL in lamports (1e9)
   &slippageBps=50       ← 0.5% slippage tolerance

2. POST https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/swap
   Body: { quoteResponse, userPublicKey, dynamicComputeUnitLimit: true }
   → Returns: { swapTransaction: "<base64 VersionedTransaction>" }

3. Store base64 string in pending_txs.payload
4. Include in tx_signing_request WS message as serialized_tx
```

The mobile app decodes `serialized_tx` (base64-encoded binary `VersionedTransaction`):

```typescript
// mobile: agent-provider.tsx
const txBytes = Buffer.from(serialized_tx, 'base64');
const versionedTx = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(txBytes);
const signature = await signAndSendTransaction(versionedTx);
```

### Transaction Expiry

Jupiter quotes embed a recent blockhash. Solana transactions expire after ~150 blocks (~90 seconds). The server sets `expires_at = now + 5 minutes` — conservative enough for the user to see and act on the notification.

`expires_at` signals when the signing request UI should be dismissed — not when the transaction expires on-chain (~90s). If the blockhash goes stale before the user signs, the Solana network will reject it. Use `POST /simulate/resend-tx` to rebuild with a fresh quote and re-push.

## Push Notifications

**File:** [src/notifications/expoPush.ts](src/notifications/expoPush.ts)

### Why Expo Push (FCM Relay)?

Expo's push service acts as a relay to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Benefits:
- One API call to Expo's servers handles FCM delivery
- No need to manage FCM credentials server-side
- Works across Expo managed and bare workflow
- Expo handles batching and error reporting

### Registration Flow

1. Mobile app calls `expo-notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync()` on launch
2. Token (format: `ExponentPushToken[xxx]`) is sent to `POST /device/register`
3. Server stores token + wallet address in `devices` table
4. On `queueSigningRequest`: server calls `sendPushToDevices()` which sends to all registered tokens

### Notification Payload

```typescript
// When the agent queues a signing request
await sendPushToDevices("agentX: Trade Ready to Sign", reason, {
  type: "tx_signing_request",
  tx_id: tx.tx_id,
});
```

The mobile app's notification handler opens the app and surfaces the signing modal when tapped.

### Flow 2: Price Alert → Autonomous Swap → User Signing

This is the most important flow and the least obvious one to follow in the code. There are three non-trivial design decisions worth understanding before reading the diagram.

**1. The trigger context pipeline**

When `priceMonitor` detects that an alert has fired, it needs to pass the alert's metadata (target price, triggered price, direction, token) all the way through to the `pending_txs` row so that clients reconnecting later see accurate data in re-delivered signing requests — not placeholder zeros. The challenge is that this data travels through two async hops: `priceMonitor` → `AgentRunner` → `queueSigningRequest` tool.

The solution is a module-level `Map` in `priceMonitor.ts`:

```typescript
// priceMonitor.ts — when an alert fires
alertTriggerContext.set(`alert_${alert.id}`, {
  alertId: alert.id, token: alert.token,
  targetPrice: target, triggeredPrice: price, direction: alert.direction,
});
agentRunner.enqueue(prompt, `alert_${alert.id}`);
```

**2. Why `queueSigningRequest` is a factory function**

The four agent tools are module-level constants — they have no access to the current session. `queueSigningRequest` is the exception because it needs the session ID to look up the trigger context Map. Making it a factory solves this cleanly:

```typescript
// AgentRunner.ts — inside run(sessionId, prompt)
tools: {
  getSolanaPrice: getSolanaPriceTool,        // static — no session context needed
  createPriceAlert: createPriceAlertTool,    // static
  queueSigningRequest: createQueueSigningRequestTool(sessionId),  // captures sessionId
  getPendingSigningRequests: getPendingSigningRequestsTool,       // static
}
```

Inside the factory, the tool reads and deletes the trigger context in one step:

```typescript
// solana.ts — inside createQueueSigningRequestTool(sessionId).execute()
const ctx = alertTriggerContext.get(sessionId); // e.g. { triggeredPrice: 142.10, ... }
alertTriggerContext.delete(sessionId);           // consume — won't be re-used
await createPendingTx({ ..., trigger_price: ctx?.triggeredPrice, alert_id: ctx?.alertId });
```

**3. Reconnect re-delivery**

If the app was closed when the signing request arrived, it reconnects and the server re-delivers all non-expired pending txs. Because `trigger_price` is now stored on the `pending_txs` row and the query JOINs `price_alerts` for `target_price` and `direction`, the re-delivered message is identical to the original — no placeholder zeros.

                            │   UPDATE pending_txs SET status='confirmed'
```

### Reconnection Handling

When the mobile app reconnects to WS:

```typescript
// wsRouter.ts — on new connection
// JOIN with price_alerts so re-delivered messages carry accurate trigger metadata
// (real target_price, triggered_price, direction) instead of placeholder zeros.
const pending = await getPendingTxsWithTrigger();
for (const tx of pending) {
  send(socket, {
    type: "tx_signing_request",
    payload: {
      tx_id: tx.tx_id,
      from_token: tx.from_token,
      to_token: tx.to_token,
      amount: Number(tx.amount),
      serialized_tx: tx.payload,
      reason: "Pending signing request from a previous agent decision",
      trigger: {
        alert_id: Number(tx.alert_id ?? 0),
        token: tx.alert_token ?? tx.from_token,
        target_price: Number(tx.alert_target_price ?? 0),
        triggered_price: Number(tx.trigger_price ?? 0),
        direction: tx.alert_direction ?? "below",
      },
      expires_at: tx.expires_at,
    },
  });
}
```

This ensures signing requests aren't lost if the app was killed between the push notification arriving and the user tapping it.

## Simulate Endpoints Reference

**File:** [src/routes/simulateRouter.ts](src/routes/simulateRouter.ts)

These endpoints let you test the full price-alert → agent → signing flow in seconds without waiting for real price movements.

### `POST /simulate/price-trigger`

Set a mock price and run `checkAlerts()` immediately.

**Request:**
```json
{ "token": "SOL", "price": 140 }
```

**Response:**
```json
{ "ok": true, "token": "SOL", "simulated_price": 140, "message": "Mock price for SOL set to 140; active alerts evaluated." }
```

**Typical test flow:**
```bash
# 1. Create an alert
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders/alert -H "X-Api-Key: helloworld" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"SOL","target_price":150,"direction":"below","from_token":"SOL","to_token":"USDC","amount":1}'

# 2. Trigger it
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/price-trigger -H "X-Api-Key: helloworld" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"SOL","price":140}'
# → Agent is invoked → builds tx → pushes to mobile WS + Expo push

# 3. Reset for next test cycle
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simulate/reset -H "X-Api-Key: helloworld"
```

---

### `GET /simulate/prices`

Show current price cache (what the price monitor and tools see).

**Response:**
```json
{ "prices": { "SOL": 185.42, "USDC": 1.0 } }
```

---

### `POST /simulate/push-tx`

Build a real Jupiter swap tx and push it directly — no agent, no alert needed. Use this to test the notification → `AgentTxModal` → signing flow in isolation.

**Prerequisites:** Mobile app must be connected and `POST /device/register` must have been called with a wallet address.

**Response `201`:**
```json
{ "ok": true, "tx_id": "...", "ws_clients_notified": 1, "expires_at": "..." }
```

The amount is hardcoded to 0.01 SOL → USDC (small enough to be safe for testing on mainnet).

---

### `POST /simulate/resend-tx`

Rebuild an expired or stale tx with a fresh Jupiter quote and re-push to all WS clients. Jupiter quotes embed a blockhash that expires in ~90s — use this when the user didn't sign in time.

**Request:**
```json
{ "tx_id": "2e31b14f-..." }
```
Omit body to resend all pending txs.

---

### `POST /simulate/reset`

Reset test state between cycles without restarting the server:
- Flips all `triggered` alerts back to `active`
- Deletes all `pending_signature` txs

**Response:**
```json
{ "ok": true, "alerts_reset": 2, "message": "2 alert(s) back to active, pending txs cleared." }
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "crypto.getRandomValues() not supported"

**Cause:** React Native (mobile side) lacks a Web Crypto implementation. Not a server issue.

**Solution (mobile):** Import `react-native-quick-crypto` polyfill as the first import in the app entry file.

### Agent produces duplicate signing requests

**Cause:** Price monitor fired twice before the `triggered` status update committed, OR two simultaneous WS clients sent the same prompt.

**Solution:** The agent calls `getPendingSigningRequests` before calling `queueSigningRequest`. If the system prompt is correctly instructing the agent to check first, duplicates should be rare. The `triggered` flag in `price_alerts` prevents the price monitor from re-firing the same alert.

### Jupiter swap build fails: "No route found"

**Cause:** Amount too small (dust), or no liquidity for the token pair at current price.

**Solution:** Use a minimum of 0.01 SOL for test swaps. Ensure token mints are correct (SOL and USDC mainnet mints are hardcoded in `buildTx.ts`).

### WS clients don't receive `tx_signing_request` after `simulate/push-tx`

**Cause:** No WS client is connected (app not open), or the WS connection dropped.

**Solution:** Check `ws_clients_notified` in the response. If `0`, open the app and ensure the WS connection is established (you'll see "connected" in the chat UI). The push notification should have woken the app.

### Agent isn't reasoning correctly / takes wrong action

**Cause:** System prompt or conversation history may not provide enough context.

**Solution:** Check `GET /agent/history` to see what context the agent sees. For autonomous sessions, check server logs for the injected alert context. Adjust `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `AgentRunner.ts` if the agent's behavior needs tuning.
